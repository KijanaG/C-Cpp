# C-Cpp
Tufts University Computer Science C/C++ course overview

Two courses: the first consisting of a Data Structures curriculum (C++) 
and the second Machine Structures & Assembly Language Programming (C). 
The courses goals are to build fundamental and professional software 
development skills through rigorous programming projects that enforce
an adherence to specs and instruct the creation of design documents,
thorough commenting and testing of a modularized code base with grades
as the ultimate incentive. The former class, DS, required about 15 hours
of dedication per week, whereas the latter currently required on average
35 hours per week. Nonetheless, the projects are aimed at getting students
very familiar with the core concepts of the computer and computer science 
as a discipline.
